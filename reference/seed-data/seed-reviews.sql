If you turn to this animated Disney classic for laughs and warm fuzzies, then you are clearly not my friend and do not follow my on Friendango. I tried to warn you. It's a beautiful movie with adorable characters and classic songs, but that's not all it provides.

Context aside, this movie is pretty dumb. Why did all of Disney's characters sound like that back then? The “funny” parts of this movie aren't that funny.

'If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all.'” Words to live by. That's what this movie provides. Some people have been calling this movie “boring,” but it scratches the same itch as “slice of life” anime series. It's a sweet and simple lifestyle where the biggest challenges are Bambi trying to walk for the first time, and the biggest laughs are small moments like Bambi saying “BIRD” really loudly. Nothing soothes my soul like tiny baby forest creatures becoming best friends and saying “bird.” 10/10, will keep on repeat forever.", 10, "4", "2020-02-06 10:16:20", "2020-02-06 10:16:20"),

It's our last chance to see the cast of Firefly in action. I appreciate that this movie really did it big, bigger than their SyFy series budget allowed them to in the past. But it's clear the writers were trying to make the whole saving-River plot make sense. They really wanted to tie up that arch with a neat little bow, and that's a trap that a lot of television series fall into. I like space and guns and their use of Chinese curse words.

The production value's a little higher,  the battles are more epic (because no one really needs to survive to be in the next season anymore). Summer Glau really shines not just as an actress but as a martial artist. I also like her outfits. Reavers are featured more prominently in this movie than in the series, again because people are allowed to die in the movie and Reavers were generally too fiersome to fight in the series.
